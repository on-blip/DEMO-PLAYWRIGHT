  - paragraph: Trail du Souffleur
  - paragraph: Experience a picturesque 10-kilometre trail run against a stunning backdrop of cliffs in the South of the island. Gentle slopes and rolling terrain invite you to discover the coastal beauty at your own pace. Take a leisurely walk and enjoy the fresh sea breeze or pick up the pace for an exciting run. The first part of the route embraces the rugged coastline, treating you to awesome ocean views from the cliffs. Then you will proceed beneath the comforting shade of filao trees until you reach the finish line – the pristine sandy beach of Shandrani Beachcomber Resort & Spa – where the festivities await!
